| Dictionary       | Unordered                                      | Yes                 | Via Key        | Key:O(1)          | O(1)                 | Best for high performance lookups.                                                                                                 |
| SortedDictionary | Sorted                                         | No                  | Via Key        | Key: O(log n)     | O(log n)             | Compromise of Dictionary speed and ordering, uses binarysearch tree.                                                               |

| List             | User has precise control over element ordering | Yes                 | Via Index      | Index: O(1)       | O(n)                 | Best for smaller lists where direct access required and no sorting.                                                                |

| LinkedList       | User has precise control over element ordering | No                  | No             | Value:O(n)        | O(1)                 | Best for lists where inserting/deleting in middle is common and no direct access required.                                         |
| HashSet          | Unordered                                      | Yes                 | Via Key        | Key:O(1)          | O(1)                 | Unique unordered collection, like a Dictionary except key and value are same object.                                               |
| SortedSet        | Sorted                                         | No                  | Via Key        | Key:O(log n)      | O(log n)             | Unique sorted collection, like SortedDictionary except key and value are same object.                                              |

| Queue            | FIFO                                           | Yes                 | Only Front     | Front: O(1)       | O(1)                 | Essentially same as List except only process as FIFO                                                                               |
